Static Block is used to implement "Pre requiste" actions where it run before main class
It is a small set of Instruction where methods are set of instruction contains lots of action 
As it run before main method can we try static block without main method ?
No we cannot try static block without main method

Non static block runs "only after creation of instance in main class" and the sequence will be 
static block
non static block 
main method sysout statement
If we provide SYSOUT statement before instance creation "Staticandnonstatic sc=new Staticandnonstatic();" then sequence will be 
static block
main method sysout statement
non static block    // it will execute only after creation of instance in main class

if we include more than one static block and block than output will be 
static block 1  //run only once before main method
static block 2  //run only once before main method
Main block Sysout statement  //Main method SYSOUT statement placed before creation of instances
Non static block1  //Non static block run in order of it declared after instance creation
Non static block2  //Non static block run in order of it declared after instance creation
constructor block  //constructor block run once object created where we cannot declare multiple constructor
Non static block1
Non static block2
constructor block


DisAdvantages of Static
The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
this and super cannot be used in static context.
Access only static type data (static type instance variable).
Call only static method ,if non-static then compile time error.
No need the class object to call the static method.
Cant use this and super keyword otherwise compile time error.
