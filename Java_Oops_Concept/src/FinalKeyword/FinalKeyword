Final Keyword

final class - we cannot extend (ie. No Inheritance applicable)
final method - we cannot override
final variable - we cannot reassign (ie. constant values final int pi=3.65;). 
Here we can use variable many times but yu cannot change value 

Note : Important

public abstract final class parent
{
//if abstract present it mean we can utilise parent method through method overriding in child class
//if final keyword appears it mean we cannot extend class

what would be the output ?
Ans : It throw error as "Illegal combination of Modifier"
}
