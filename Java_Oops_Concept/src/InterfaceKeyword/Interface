Interface is not a class its a Rules or Contract
As interface is not a class so obviously we cannot create object as interface contains full of abstract methods
interface can be public and package modifier

Where you cannot create constructor for interface but you can create constructor that can be access from your child class 

Important :
By default variables are Final(ie. you cannot change value of interface in your implements class)
Note: Even though you try to change (from i=10 to i=20) also it will give interface value (i=10)
By default Methods are abstract(ie. all methods of interface should be implemented in child class(implements))
By default Interface Methods are static  


Dynamic Binding possible in Interface 
        Company comp=new Employee();
		comp.comeOnTime();  --> Interface class method
		comp.takeLeave();   --> Interface class method
		comp.getSalary();   --> Interface class method
		comp.lesuireTime(); --> Implemented class method which cannot be access in dynamic binding
Where (Company is interface) and (Employee is implemented class)
Dynamic binding is that we can oly access overridden method but we cannot access implemented class methods
