class is a templete
Abstraction is a Data Hiding process
Method without having body is called abstract method. 
if you have one abstract method than you need to declare class as abstract class 
Note : The abstract method will never be final because the abstract class must implement all the abstract methods.

you cannot create object for Abstact class (Worker) but you can create constructor that can be access from your child class 
Where you cannot create constructor for interface
To utilise Abstract class we need to create sub class and define abstract method (Sub Worker)


Note: usage of Abstract class is to give pressure to child class to implement abstract method. 
else subclass wont create object after it got extend from abstract class.
ie. RBI mandatory rules should be follow by all banks. its like forcing to do the job done.

you can also create empty method to remove abstract like 
public void hike()
{
//empty method without body
}
